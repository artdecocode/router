`@depack/router` is The Preact Router Component For Compilation With Depack.

```sh
yarn add -E @depack/router
```

The original source code is from https://github.com/developit/preact-router but it was modified to be able to compile front-ends that use it with Depack using Google Closure Compiler.

> *Connect your Preact components up to that address bar.*

> `preact-router` provides a <Router /> component that conditionally renders its children when the URL matches their path. It also automatically wires up <a /> elements to the router.
